Hello,

We are writing to notify you about platform-wide pay changes for training
tasks.

Beginning May 20th, 2024, we are making changes to training tasks across the
platform. Training tasks are the first few tasks when you join a project, and
are focused on making sure you understand the details of your assigned project,
and are marked accordingly.

Your new training task pay rate is going to be $12.66/ hour and will be
reflected in your pay dashboard.

Note: this change affects only training tasks. It does not affect your existing
base pay rate or other monetary rewards for which you are eligible.

Please reach out to our support team at support@tryoutlier.zendesk.com if you
have any questions.

Thank you,

The Outlier team
