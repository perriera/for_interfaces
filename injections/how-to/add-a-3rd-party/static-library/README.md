## How to add a 3rd party static library to your `injections.io(injections_cpp)` based project
**Given** the need to add 3rd party party library (for example `mysql`) support to your `injections.io(injections_cpp)` based project **when** we use adding `mysql` as an example of how to do this **then** we will have a working example of how to add 3rd party libraires using `CPM/CMakeLists.txt` syntax.

### Prerequisites
 - a project created using `injections.io(injections_cpp)` as a template
 - a good computer and a decent Internet connection

### Wish Case
The popular and well-established `mysql` database api will be used as an example of how to do this
#### Setup `mysql` for incorporation
- Do [How to install mysql onto Ubuntu](https://github.com/perriera/for_interfaces/blob/main/db/mysql/README.md)

write better software for real world applications **when** we develop source code with `no if-then-else` constructs **then** source code becomes more predicable and easier to manage
