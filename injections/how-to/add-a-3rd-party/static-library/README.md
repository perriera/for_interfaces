## How to add a 3rd party static library to your `injections.io(injections_cpp)` based project
**Given** the need to add 3rd party party library (for example `mysql`) support to your `injections.io(injections_cpp)` based project **when** we use adding `mysql` as an example of how to do this **then** we will have a working example of how to add 3rd party libraires using `CPM/CMakeLists.txt` syntax.

### Prerequisites
 - a project created using `injections.io(injections_cpp)` as a template
 - a good computer and a decent Internet connection

### Wish Case
The popular and well-established `mysql` database api will be used as an example of how to do this
- Do [How to install mysql onto Ubuntu](https://github.com/perriera/for_interfaces/blob/main/db/mysql/README.md)
- Do [How to install mysql API support (using CPM/CMakeLists.txt syntax)](https://github.com/perriera/for_interfaces/blob/main/db/mysql/CPP.md)

### Summary
You now have installed a 3rd party static library to your `injections.io(injections_cpp)` based project
