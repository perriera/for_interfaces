## How to add a 3rd party static library to your `injections.io(injections_cpp)` based project
**Given** the need to add 3rd party party library (for example `mysql`) support to your `injections.io(injections_cpp)` based project **when** we use adding `mysql` as an example of how to do this **then** we will have a working example of how to add 3rd party libraires using CPM/CMakeLists.txt syntax.



write better software for real world applications **when** we develop source code with `no if-then-else` constructs **then** source code becomes more predicable and easier to manage
