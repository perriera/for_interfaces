## How To Secure Apache with Let's Encrypt on Ubuntu 20.04
> To be able to host multiple websites off one single web server and for those to be https compliant is worth it's weight in gold. This How-To describes how to set up such a platform using Apache, certbot and a well established version of Ubuntu.

 1. **GIVEN** we would like to have multiple websites off one single web server
 2. **WHEN** we use certbot on an apache server on a stable Ubuntu platform
 3. **THEN** we can have all the benefits that come with https for multiple websites

### Prerequisites
 - Ubuntu 20.04 instance
 - Access to the Internet
 - ssh key access 
 - a domain name pointing towards the Linux box 

### Wish Case
Assuming you have an Ubuntu instance with ssh key access ready to go:
 - [ ] ssh into the Ubuntu instance:
```
ssh sammy@your_server_ip
```
 - [ ] make sure it is up to date
```
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo apt -y autoremove
sudo reboot
```
 - [ ] relog back into Ubuntu instance
 - [ ] now add an a virtual host configuration 
```
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/freeformjs.org.conf
```
 - [ ] now the following contents (and replace 'freeformjs.org' with your specific domain name)
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin admin@freeformjs.org
    ServerName freeformjs.org
     <Directory /var/www/freeformjs.org/public_html>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
     </Directory>

    ServerAlias www.freeformjs.org 
    DocumentRoot /var/www/freeformjs.org/public_html
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
 - [ ] now create a place for the virtual host, (again replace 'freeformjs.org' with your specific domain name)
```
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/freeformjs.org/public_html
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/freeformjs.org/public_html
vi /var/www/freeformjs.org/public_html/index.html
```
Add the following content for the index page:
```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Welcome to Your_domain!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Success!  The your_domain virtual host is working!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```
 - [ ] now enable the new virtual host (and disable the default one):
```
sudo a2ensite freeformjs.org.conf
sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
 - [ ] now test that apach2 can digest the above
```
sudo apache2ctl configtest
```
You should see only:
```
Syntax OK
```
 - [ ] now add apache2 HTTPS support to the firewall
```
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow 'Apache Full'
sudo ufw delete allow 'Apache'
sudo ufw status
```
 - [ ] now make sure your domain name is pointing to this Linux server
 - [ ] (check that the A record is pointing the desired ip address)
```
ping ip_address
ping domain name
```
> The ip values should be the same
> In the case where the IP address is not the same see Alternate Case below
 - [ ] now add an SSL Certificate (compliments certbot):
```
sudo certbot --apache
```
PAY CLOSE ATTENTION to the dialog that comes up on the screen:

 - add your email
 - accept the license
 - say Yes
 - specify "1 2" for both domain names
 - select 2 to Redirect to HTTPS
 - [ ] now curl the ip address
```
curl http://freeformjs.org
```
The contents of the apache server startup page should display.
 - [ ] now setup certbot to automatically keep the certificates updated
```
sudo systemctl status certbot.timer
```

At this point you should back up your Ubuntu instance before continuing.

### Alternate Case
> **AH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine**
> This might show up and it means there is something missing from apache2 setup:
```
sudo vi /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```
Add this to the bottom:
```
# Include the virtual host configurations:
IncludeOptional sites-enabled/*.conf
# vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet
ServerName 127.0.0.1
```
Then rerun the test:
```
sudo apache2ctl configtest
```
### Alternate Case
> **The ip values should be the same, (but are not)**
> This happens in the case your DNS / Nameservers domain name regisitration is not pointing to the website's IP address as well as the website's IP has not been configured to expect the domain name (DNS records). The details of which can be too detailed for a single how-to page but the basic requirements have been attached as images, (see 001.png and 002.png). 


### Summary 
Now you have a platform with which to install the C++11/17 tools necessary for *(perriera) /  extras_dbo* cloned projects.
