### What are issue type hierarchy levels?
By default, Jira supports three levels of hierarchy:
> 1. Epic issues, which represent high-level initiatives or bigger pieces of work in Jira. For software teams, an epic may represent a new feature they're developing. For IT service teams, epics may represent a major service change or upgrade. For business teams, epics may represent major deliverables or phases of a project.
>
> 2. Standard issues represent regular business tasks. In Jira, standard issues are where daily work is discussed and carried out by team members. For software teams, standard issues (like bugs or stories) estimate and track the effort required to build an interaction or other end goal in your team's software. For service teams, standard issues represent different requests made by your team's customers, like requesting service or support, or reporting problems or incidents with your infrastructure. For business teams, standard issues represent and track your team member's daily tasks.
>
> 3. Subtask issues, which can help your team break a standard issue into smaller chunks. This can be helpful if your team has a task that requires multiple people working on it, or if your team underestimates the scope or complexity of their work. Subtasks can be described and estimated separately to their related standard issue and can help your team better understand and estimate similar work in the future.
